		<p><u>The Short Version</u>:<br>
		I'm a designer currently studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley.  I was born in Texas but spent most of my life in Vancouver, Canada.  I love music and food.
		<br><br>
		<u>The Long Version</u>:<br>
		I don't like pigeon-holing myself into categories or roles so I don't particularly feel comfortable calling myself just a "designer" or just a "student".  I don't mean to sound pretentious, I just feel that although design and being a student are very large chunks of my identity, I have so much passion and love for other parts of my life.  Like teaching.  I've always loved teaching and have recently been blessed with the opportunity to teach my fellow Bears about designing websites.  I'm also really passionate about music.  Like really, really passionate.  My 2015 <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/jessheisme">Spotify</a> Year in Music told me I listened to 89 thousand minutes worth of music that year.  That's 62 days of music!  That's 17% of an entire year!  (And that's not even counting the music I listened to on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jessheisme">Soundcloud</a> or iTunes.)  When I'm not busy spending hours making playlists, I can be seen eating quality food or taking photos of said quality food.  If you're reading this, <strike>it's too late</strike> thank you for taking interest in the long version and getting to know me a bit beyond "designer at UC Berkeley".
