			<p id="about-text">On the very last day of class my Intro to Cognitive Science professor gave us his self-proclaimed "<em>5 Keys to Happiness</em>", and one of them was to <em><b>spend your money on experiences rather than materials; so go take a trip somewhere</b></em>.  My family has always been fond of traveling, but it wasn't until that day in that classroom that I realized how much I truly enjoyed our various excursions.  Whether it were the exotic cuisines or the unfamiliar streets, I always had a penchant for going to new places.
			<br><br>
			I saw these trips as opportunities.  Opportunities to learn more about the world I inhabit with 7 billion others, opportunities to capture sights and sounds foreign to me, quickly, before I would leave and unlikely encounter them again, and opportunities to escape the bubble I'm in &mdash; the bubble that is UC Berkeley, the bubble that is privileged America &mdash; and realize that there is so, so much more out there.
			<br><br>
			This site isn't a blog and it isn't a photo gallery.  The images and videos you see are more of a reminder for myself, and maybe for others who have come across similar paths, of moments and places perhaps otherwise forgotten.  They're little mementos, each with their own larger stories.</p>
