		<h1>Interning at Adobe</h1>
		<p>In the summer of 2015, I interned at Adobe's headquarters in San Jose as a UI/UX Web Design Intern on Adobe's IT Security team.  My main project was to help the security team redesign their existing Sharepoint site, which was outdated and in need of a new coat of paint.  To start this process, I spoke with members on the team about the existing site: its purpose, its use cases, its strengths, and its weaknesses.  From there, I made sketches and Illustrator mockups and started the process of getting feedback and iterating.  Once the team was content with the design, I translated the mockups into code and implemented them into the security team Sharepoint site.

		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>The Security team at any company isn't always the most exciting, but no one can doubt its importance.  Security should be weaved into anything and everything you do and should be accessible to everyone.  My task was to take a plain and unappealing site and transform it into something exciting and approachable for employees within the company.</p>

		<h2>Research, Mockup, Code</h2>
		<p>A lot of my time was spent understanding how the security team within Adobe was organized, as this heavily influenced the layout of the site itself.  I discovered that the team was composed of five smaller divisions, each with their own services.  Since this was a site for users to learn more about the teams, I thought I would use the five services as a starting point for navigation.  After I understood the architecture of the site, I began making various mockups and getting feedback on those.  After a few iterations, I turned these mockups into code.</p>

		<h2>Continuing My Internship: Graphic Design and Animations</h2>
		<p>My internship was extended into the school year.  During this time, I helped the security team create security awareness infographics as well as animations.</p>
